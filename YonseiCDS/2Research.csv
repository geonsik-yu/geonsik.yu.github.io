In this paper, we focus on the inverse chromatic number problem for certain classes of graphs. First, we discuss diverse possible versions and then focus on two application frameworks which motivate this problem in interval and permutation graphs: the inverse booking problem and the inverse track assignment problem. The inverse booking problem is closely related to some previously known scheduling problems; we propose new hardness results and polynomial cases. The inverse track assignment problem motivates our study of the inverse chromatic number problem in permutation graphs; we show how to solve in polynomial time a generalization of the problem with a bounded number of colors."	research_42	Citizen/User Community	Research trends in social media: A meta-analysis of business-related literature	"Hyun Kwak, Sunju Park, Seungwha Chung, and Yerim Chung"		Knowledge Management Research	"The number of studies on social media has increased rapidly worldwide. There has been, however, little e!ort to assess the achievements and limitations of social media studies up to present. The purpose of this study is to provide a systematical viewpoint on social media research published by scholarly business-related journals. Our analysis focus on research topic, functionality, targeted media types, methodology, and characteristics. User research receives the most attention, followed by e!ect research in terms of developmental models of media research agenda. The major methodological trend is online survey. Facebook and twitter are the two most popular mediums studied in literature, and social media is mainly characterized as information sharing as well as relationship building. Two recommendations are suggested in ways to strengthen social media research: more various topics and application areas, and the rigor and diversity of research methods."	research_33	Institutional Ecosystem	Activation Strategies of the Disaster Public-Apps in Korea	Dong-Hee Shin and Yong-Moon Kim		The Korea Contents Association	"In recent years, a series of large-scale disastrous accidents have been occurred frequently both in public and private sector. Such disasters become catastrophe due to poor early response and delayed prompt rescue. Damage from catastrophe could have been drastically reduced or minimized with effective response and recovery management. The smart phone-based mobile applications have important potentials in providing solutions for the effective response and recovery management. Mobile applications can greatly improve risk communication in case of disasters by integrating process of exchange information and data on risk among risk evaluators, risk managers, and other interested parties. In this light of potentials, this study investigates the measures and management to better manage early responses and to effectively deal with domestic disaster-related of the status of public applications service, and utilization. <br> This study examines how disaster applications can be better used and how effective information dissemination through applications could help the post-disaster management process. Based on this findings, it proposes a guideline of effective disaster-related applications by public sector for the future development of actual services and activation solutions. The results show that ""User Promptness Side"" and ""Content Believability Side"" factors found to be the two most significant factors in the disaster-related applications by public sector. Discussion and implications are discussed."	research_24	Citizen/User Community	AdolescentsÅf Characteristics and Motives in Predicting Problematic Mobile Phone Use	Yongsuk Hwang and Namsu Park		International Telecommunications Policy Review	"The purpose of this study is to (1) identify addiction symptoms that are uniquely associated with mobile phone use among adolescents in Korea; (2) examine how background characteristics are related to addiction symptoms; and (3) explore how background characteristics, motives, and the amount of mobile phone use predict addictive use of mobile phones. Using a survey of 550 adolescents in Korea, this study identified three addiction symptoms: intrusion, attachment, and withdrawal. The regression models suggest that background characteristics, including impulsivity, peer conformity, imitation, and social anxiety, strongly explain the variance of addictive symptoms. Results show that instrumental motives for using the mobile phone are positively related to addictive behaviors. The amount of mobile phone use was positively related to addiction, even though the percentage of the variance explained in the regression models was small."	research_1
